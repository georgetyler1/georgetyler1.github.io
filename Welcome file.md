<p>Hi there, welcome to my blog! I am a Maths student and Tutor who has just finished his Master’s. I am hoping to use this space as a means for conducting projects relating to Mathematics and it’s applications. In my fourth year, I specialised mostly Numerical Analysis so a lot of projects may lie in relation to this field however, I hope to branch out from this over the next year (2021-2022).</p>
